Problem installing Windows 11 Pro ISO file on an UTM's VM on a MacBook Pro (3.5 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7) 16GB RAM
I get the following error message and install fails:

The operating system couldn’t be loaded because the digital signature of a file or one of its dependencies couldn’t be verified.

File:\Windows\System32\drivers\vioscsi.sys

Error Code: 0x0000428

I downloaded the Windows 11 Pro ISO file from Microsoft's website. I also Installed the CrystalFetch Version 2.0.0 (3).

Has anyone experienced this problem, and found a solution? The errir is on the System file called vioscsi.sys which is inside the Windows 11 Pro ISO file.

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks, Saeed M.
